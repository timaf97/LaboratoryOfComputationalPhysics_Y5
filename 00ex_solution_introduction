1.The MickeyMouse problem

a) Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3 print Mickey instead of the corresponding number and for the multiples of 5 print Mouse. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print MickeyMouse

b) Put the result in a tuple and substitute Mickey with Donald and Mouse with Duck

2. The swap function

Write a function that swap the values of two input variables x and y (whatever the type). Try to do that also without a temporary variable

3. Computing the distance

Write a function that calculates and returns the euclidean distance between two points u and v, where u and v are both 2-tuples (x,y). For example, if u=(3,0) and v=(0,4), the function should return 5

4. Counting letters

Write a program to calculate the number of times each character occurs in a given string s. Ignore differneces in capitalization
s="Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. \
But for multiples of three print Mickey instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Mouse. \
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print MickeyMouse"

5. Isolating the unique

Write a function that determines and count the unique numbers in the list l
l = [36, 45, 58, 3, 74, 96, 64, 45, 31, 10, 24, 19, 33, 86, 99, 18, 63, 70, 85,
 85, 63, 47, 56, 42, 70, 84, 88, 55, 20, 54, 8, 56, 51, 79, 81, 57, 37, 91,
 1, 84, 84, 36, 66, 9, 89, 50, 42, 91, 50, 95, 90, 98, 39, 16, 82, 31, 92, 41,
 45, 30, 66, 70, 34, 85, 94, 5, 3, 36, 72, 91, 84, 34, 87, 75, 53, 51, 20, 89, 51, 20]

6. Combination of functions

Write two functions - one that returns the square of a number, and one that returns the cube. Now write a third function that returns the number raised to the 6th power using the two previous functions.

7. Cubes

Create a list of the cubes of x for x in [0, 10] using:

a) a for loop

b) a list comprehension

8. Nested list comprehension

A Pythagorean triple is an integer solution to the Pythagorean theorem a2+b2=c2a2+b2=c2. The first Pythagorean triple is (3,4,5). Find and put in a tuple all unique Pythagorean triples for the positive integers a, b and c less than 100.

9. Normalization

Write a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns it with the entries normalized to one
